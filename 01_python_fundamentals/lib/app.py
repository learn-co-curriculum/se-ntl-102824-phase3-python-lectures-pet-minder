import ipdb

# ðŸš¨ To enable ipdb debugging, first import "ipdb"

# 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
# If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
# If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
# In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

# Note => Feel free to set your own values for "pet_mood" to view various outputs.

pet_mood = "Hungry"
pet_name = "Zeus"

# if pet_mood == "Hungry":
#     print(f"{pet_name} needs to be fed!")
# elif pet_mood == "Rowdy":
#     print(f"{pet_name} needs needs a walk!")
# else:
#     print(f"{pet_name} is all good!")


# 2. âœ… Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:
# If pet_food is "Hungry!" => "Rose needs to be fed."
# In all other cases => "Rose is all good."
(
    print(f"{pet_name} needs to be fed!")
    if pet_mood == "Hungry"
    else print(f"{pet_name} is all good!")
)

# 3. âœ… Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"
# Test invocation of "say_hello" in ipdb using "say_hello()"
# say_hello() => "Hello, world!"


def say_hello():
    return "Hello world!"


# 4. âœ… Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name
# Test invocation of "pet_greeting" in ipdb using "pet_greeting()"
# pet_greeting("Rose") => "Rose says hello!"
# pet_greeting("Spot") => "Spot says hello!"


def pet_greeting(name):
    # ipdb.set_trace()
    return f"{name} says hello!"


# pet_greeting("Spot")
# pet_greeting("Chase")


# 5. âœ… Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods
# Test invocation of "pet_status" in ipdb using "pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood)"
# pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!") => "Rose needs to be fed."
# pet_status("Spot", "Rowdy!") => "Spot needs a walk."
# pet_status("Bud", "Relaxed") => "Bud is all good."


def pet_status(name, mood):
    if mood == "Hungry":
        return f"{name} needs to be fed!"
    elif mood == "Rowdy":
        return f"{name} needs needs a walk!"
    else:
        return f"{name} is all good!"


# Take a moment to note that "pet_name" and "pet_mood" parameters are within Local Scope and take priority over "pet_name" and "pet_mood"
# in Global Scope.


def change_mood(pet_name, new_mood):
    global pet_mood
    pet_mood = new_mood
    print(f"{pet_name} is feeling {pet_mood}")


# 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors.
# If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
# pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
# pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"


def pet_birthday(age):
    try:
        return f"Happy Birthday! Your pet is now {age + 1}."
    except:
        return "Type Error Occurred"
